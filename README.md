This is an online web application to be paired with the mobile game Pokemon GO. 

In the game, there are various points of interest that coincide with real-world locations. When a player interacts with these, they gain in-game benefits. To aid players in their gameplay, this application can be used to view a wide range of locations that other players have checked that have added information about the existing points of interest, allowing for more efficient and collaborative gameplay.

Users can also add their own temporary point of interest by clicking a button which will enable Google map marker plotting. Once they place a marker, it will 
dissapear after 30 minutes.

To operate within the spirit of the game & terms of service, points of inerest that are permenantly in the game are loaded from an external database and plotted onto the map canvas, rather than scraping data from the game servers.
