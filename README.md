This is an online web application to be used in tandem with the mobile game Pokemon GO. 
In the game, there are certain points of interests called Pokestops. When a player interacts with these they will give the player a quest.
Certain quests give desireable rewards and this website helps map out which Pokestops give quests with good rewards.

The user can also add a marker of there own by clicking a button which will enable marker plotting. Once they place a marker, it will 
dissapear after 30 minutes. The purpose of this is to highlight a point of interest such as a rare Pokemon, meeting point or something else.

This website is regularly updated and has a small userbase local to Oskaloosa, Iowa.
