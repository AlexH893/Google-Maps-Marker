# jsGoogleMapsAPI
Uses google maps API to allow users to send/update information about a specific marker. Loads markers from an XML file and DB and plots them onto the canvas. Also allows users to submit there own markers which are deleted in 30 minute intervals using a cron job.

This is an online web application to be used in tandem with the mobile game Pokemon GO. 
In the game, there are certain points of interests called Pokestops. When a player interacts with these they will give the player a quest.
Certain quests give desireable rewards and this website helps map out which Pokestops give quests with good rewards.

The user can also add a marker of there own by clicking a button which will enable marker plotting. Once they place a marker, it will 
dissapear after 30 minutes. The purpose of this is to highlight a point of interest such as a rare Pokemon, meeting point or something else.

This website is regularly updated and has a small userbase local to Oskaloosa, Iowa.
